XRLP Hackathon: Empowering ESG Initiatives with Decentralized Finance

This project was developed as part of the XRLP Hackathon, with the goal of designing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions that align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Our mission is to create transparent and sustainable financial systems that empower communities and drive positive social impact.
Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following key components:
1. XRLP Wallet

This folder contains the implementation of the XRLP wallet, enabling users to securely store and manage tokens for seamless integration with the decentralized finance ecosystem.


2. Prediction Algorithm

The prediction file houses a machine learning algorithm that predicts the most suitable activity for a user to undertake, promoting engagement in ESG-aligned actions.


3. Web Application

This folder contains the files for the web app, which serves as the user interface for the platform. It allows users to interact with the XRLP wallet, view recommendations, and participate in ESG-focused activities.
